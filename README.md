Made using machine learning on a Python Jupyter notebook.

Uses an MLP program constructed using the matplotlib and sklearn libraries.

After the machine has sufficiently gone through provided training data, the accuracy of the system is gauged by testing it against a set of testing data.

The accuracy is found to be 91.47%.
