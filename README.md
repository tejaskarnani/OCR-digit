# Digit OCR

Optical Character program for recognising digits from 0 to 9. I have made this on Google Colab, using complex machine learning modules. This project has been my first practical experience with Machine Learning.

The objective of this project is to present the computer with a handwritten representation of a digit and for it to make an accurate estimation of what the digit is.

I have used the **sklearn** and the **matplotlib** Python libraries for the machine learning process.

## Using Colab

Google Colab is a Python development enviroment that allows the user to combine code, text and images in the same document, hence perfect for a project of this nature. It is extremely easy to import libraries and see the execution of the ML models we will use.

In fact, you can go to colab and directly open the file by choosing 'open with GitHub', typing the URL and picking the OCR-digit.ipynib file.

_Execution_

After downloading the files, go to Google Colab, and select "Upload", and choose the OCR.ipynib file that has just been downloaded.
A new Colaboratory should open, complete with the code, and the results.

It should look something like this:

If you wish to go through the process yourself, you will have to run all the code snippets over in the correct order by pressing the run button alongside them, as the modules and datasets will need to be loaded onto your system.

## Walking through the code

Refer to the detailed text snippets in the Colab to understand each step of the learning and recognition processes.

### Result

As is demonstrated in the last shell, the accuracy of this model is a respectable 91.47%.

## Built Using

A Python Jupiter notebook, Machine Learning executed with the matplotlib and sklearn modules.
