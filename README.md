# OCR-digit

Optical Character system for recognition of digits 0-9.

Made using machine learning on a Python Jupyter notebook.

Uses an MLP program. I have used the matplotlib and sklearn libraries.

After the machine has sufficiently gone through provided training data, the accuracy of the system is gauged by testing it against a set of testing data.

The accuracy is found to be 91.47%.
